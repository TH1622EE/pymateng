# Engineering with Python and MATLAB

This repository was developed as an evolving resource containing all things engineering. The directory structure is rather simplified with all code being written in Python or MATLAB, each of which having a corresponding directory. The subdirectories contained within each of the *MATLAB* and *Python* directories are titled based on the application specific code contained within. The design approach will be a combination of object-oriented programming (OOP) design, as well as Jupyter Notebooks in Python, and Live Scripts in MATLAB.

## Table of Contents

| Directory | Description |
| :--: | :--: |
| config | Contains files used to create identical conda environments for Python code, and general configuration information about the MATLAB environment when applicable |
| data | Contains directories containing various data sources of varying formats |
| matlab | the top-level directory containing subdirectories named consistent with the context for which the MATLAB code applies |
| python | the top-level directory containing subdirectories named consistent with the context for which the Python code applies |

## System Configurations

The configurations for both my Windows and macOS operating systems have developed and tested the code.

### macOS

| Software | Version |
